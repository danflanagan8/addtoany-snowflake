By default, AddToAny blocks all use the settings in addtoany.settings.yml.
What if you want to make multiple AddToAny blocks that have different
social channels available? That's when you need an AddToAny Snowflake
block. Add an AddToAny Snowflake block to the block layout. It initially
pulls in default settings from addtoany.settings.yml, but you can reconfigure
all of the settings so that the block overrides any or all of the global
AddToAny settings.
